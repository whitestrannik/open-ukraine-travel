# Jews in Ukraine: From the Khazars to Hollywood. A Thousand Years of Life, Faith, and Inspiration

## Ancient Roots
The history of Jews in Ukraine spans more than a thousand years. The earliest written mentions of Kyiv appear in Jewish texts of the 10th century, preserved from the era of the Khazar Khaganate. The Khazars, whose ruling elite had adopted Judaism, controlled strategic trade routes between East and West. Their cities were home to Jewish merchants, craftsmen, and scholars. Even then, on the hills of Kyiv and in the Black Sea port towns, the first communities emerged, blending the traditions of Eastern Jews with local culture.

## Ashkenazim and the Formation of Communities
From the 12th–13th centuries, fleeing pogroms and restrictions in Central Europe, Ashkenazi Jews found refuge in the lands of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and later the Russian Empire — much of which today lies within modern Ukraine.
By the 18th–19th centuries, many Ukrainian towns were essentially Jewish: in Berdychiv, Belz, Ostroh, Zhovkva, Sharhorod, and dozens of other shtetls, the share of Jewish residents reached 50–70%, and sometimes even more. The shtetl was a self-contained yet vibrant world: the synagogue, the marketplace, artisans’ workshops, and Jewish schools — cheders. Trade and cultural exchange with Ukrainian neighbors were constant, enriching both cultures.

## Cultural Interweaving
Centuries of coexistence left a deep imprint on language, cuisine, and music. Ukrainian adopted dozens of words from Yiddish — knysh, shmon, khalépa, and more. Yiddish absorbed Ukrainian vocabulary and intonation. On festive tables one could find borshch, tsimes, varenyky, and gefilte fish. Music, too, intertwined: kobzar ballads and klezmer melodies became the soundtrack of entire regions.

## The Birth of Hasidism
In the 18th century, in Medzhybizh, Podillia, the Hasidic movement was born. The Baal Shem Tov (Israel ben Eliezer) preached the joy of prayer, spiritual closeness to God, and the importance of good deeds. His disciples founded influential dynasties: Breslov (Uman), Sadigura (Sadgora, Chernivtsi), Belz (Belz), and Chabad (Hadyach). These centers remain major destinations for pilgrimage to this day.

## Ukraine — A Rare Country Where So Many Physical Traces of Jewish Life Survive
Here you can see both individual buildings and entire neighborhoods where the street layout — and even the atmosphere — have hardly changed. Here are 10 places that best convey the scope and depth of Jewish heritage:

1. **Uman (Cherkasy region)** — the main center of Jewish pilgrimage in Eastern Europe. The tomb of Rabbi Nachman, leader of the Breslov Hasidim, attracts tens of thousands of worshippers for Rosh Hashanah. The surrounding quarter turns into a living modern “shtetl” with kosher shops, guesthouses, and prayer houses. Even outside the holidays, the special energy is tangible.
2. **Sharhorod (Vinnytsia region)** — a synagogue from 1589, one of the oldest still functioning in Europe. Stone walls, arched windows, interiors with carvings and fragments of old inscriptions. Around it, the center of the old shtetl has been preserved.
3. **Sataniv (Khmelnytskyi region)** — a fortified synagogue from the 16th century with embrasures and massive walls. Nearby are houses with stone cellars and a cemetery with unique gravestones.
4. **Zhovkva (Lviv region)** — a Renaissance synagogue from the 17th century, once one of the largest in Eastern Europe; surrounded by the old city quarters.
5. **Belz (Lviv region)** — the historic center of the Belz Hasidic dynasty; cobblestone streets and single-story houses.
6. **Medzhybizh (Khmelnytskyi region)** — the tomb of the Baal Shem Tov; nearby, historic buildings and views of the castle over the Bug River.
7. **Berdychiv (Zhytomyr region)** — the mausoleum of Rabbi Levi Yitzchak, an old cemetery, and merchants’ and artisans’ houses.
8. **Kamianets-Podilskyi (Khmelnytskyi region)** — the Jewish quarter next to the legendary fortress.
9. **Sadgora (Chernivtsi)** — the residence of the Sadigura Hasidic dynasty; old synagogues and cemetery.
10. **Hadyach (Poltava region)** — the tomb of Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi (the Alter Rebbe) on a scenic hill.

And beyond these — **hundreds of unusual and fascinating places** across Ukraine: historical, cultural, religious, philosophical, and even mystical.

## Outstanding Figures
Ukraine is the birthplace of many prominent Jews: Sholem Aleichem (Pereiaslav), Golda Meir (Kyiv, Bessarabka), Israeli presidents Yitzhak Ben-Zvi (Poltava), Zalman Shazar (Kremenets), Moshe Sharett (Kherson); writers Isaac Babel (Odesa), Bruno Schulz (Drohobych), and Ilya Ehrenburg (Kyiv).

## Symbolic Cities
Odesa — a center of Jewish literature, humor, and Zionist thought; Berdychiv — the commercial heart of Volhynia in the 19th century; Dnipro — home to “Menorah,” the largest Jewish center in Europe.

## Emigration and Modern Times
From the late 19th century, hundreds of thousands of Jews from Ukraine emigrated to Palestine, and after the creation of Israel — to their new homeland. In the 1990s, more than half a million Jews and their families from Ukraine moved to Israel, making it one of the largest migrations in the country’s modern history.

## From Ukraine to Hollywood
Dozens — perhaps hundreds — of filmmakers have roots in Ukraine: Dustin Hoffman, Kirk Douglas, Steven Spielberg, the Mayer dynasty (MGM), and many others.

## Why You Should Visit
A journey through Jewish sites in Ukraine is a rare chance to combine spiritual pilgrimage, cultural discovery, and culinary pleasure.
Here you will find the streets of shtetls, historic synagogues, the birthplace of Hasidism (Medzhybizh, Uman, Belz, Hadyach), and places of tragedy (Babyn Yar, Yaniv concentration camp).
The Jewish humor of Odesa, the cuisine — gefilte fish, tsimes, cholent, knysh, bagels, matzah, strudels, forshmak.
And — the opportunity, following tradition, to quietly ask for a blessing at the tombs of spiritual leaders — for the health of loved ones, success in business, or peace in the heart.
