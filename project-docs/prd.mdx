## ðŸ”§ Content Creation Strategy for Key Sections

For **Phase 0 (MVP)**, we will focus only on implementing the core functionality for the following two sections:

- `Explore Ukraine` (`/travel-info`)
- `Entry Rules` (`/entry` or `/travel-info/entry-requirements`)

All other top-level sections (**Insurance**, **Hotels**, **Transportation**, **MICE Travel**) will be present in the top menu for UX consistency, but they will link to **static placeholder (dummy) pages** during the MVP phase. Their full implementation is deferred to later phases.

---

### Explore Ukraine (`/travel-info` category)

- **Phase 0 (MVP)**:
  - All pages under *Explore Ukraine* will be **pre-created statically** during development.
  - Content will be authored in `.mdx` format with full Ukrainian and English translations.
  - No dynamic CMS or visual editor is provided in this phase.
  - Pages will include regional highlights, destinations, culture, etc.

- **Phase 1+**:
  - A dedicated **Admin Panel** will allow:
    - Adding/modifying/removing destination pages
    - Managing translations and rich media content
    - Organizing content hierarchy

---

### Entry Rules (`/entry` or `/travel-info/entry-requirements`)

- **Phase 0 (MVP)**:
  - Layout and routing will be created during development.
  - All dynamic content (e.g. visa requirements, health rules) will be loaded from a database.
  - Country-specific rules will be seeded into the DB before launch.
  - No admin UI will exist to edit DB content.

- **Phase 1+**:
  - A structured **Admin Data Editor** will be built to allow authorized content managers to:
    - Update visa rules per nationality
    - Modify epidemic-related info
    - Maintain contact details for border and consular services
  - All updates will be logged and versioned with RBAC protections.
