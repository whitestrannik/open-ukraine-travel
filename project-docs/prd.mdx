## Section 1: Static Travel Information & Guidance

### 1.1 Overview

This section includes trusted, multilingual guidance content designed to help travelers prepare for a trip to Ukraine. It consists of two types of content:

- **Dynamic updates and blog posts** — time-sensitive or advisory content updated regularly

---

### 1.2 Goals

- Clearly separate long-term guidance from short-term alerts and updates.
- Allow flexibility in editorial workflows while maintaining trust and consistency.

  ```

---

## Section 2: Tourist Insurance

### 2.1 Overview

This section provides visitors with a simple, fast, and legally compliant way to purchase tourist insurance. The goal is to ensure that all travelers entering Ukraine can obtain the mandatory insurance certificate (covering medical expenses, including war-related risk, if applicable) through a trusted and user-friendly process.

The portal acts as a **frontend interface and broker**, while the insurance policy data and purchase flow are delegated to **external insurance providers** via API or secure redirection.

---

### 2.2 Goals

- Enable travelers to purchase valid tourist insurance required for entry.
- Clearly explain why insurance is needed and what types are available.
- Minimize friction through a mobile-first, multilingual form and instant digital delivery.
- Support easy integration with one or more trusted insurance providers.

## Section 3: Hotel Booking

### 3.1 Overview

This section enables users to search for and book accommodations in Ukraine, starting with a third-party hotel inventory integration (e.g. Booking.com, Amadeus, or other providers) and potentially evolving into direct hotel listings in later phases.

For the MVP, the portal will serve as a **frontend wrapper** around a hotel booking affiliate or API, offering users a localized and trusted interface. The backend logic, availability, booking flow, and payment will be **delegated to external services**.

---

## ❓ Open Questions & TBDs

This section tracks open decisions and design considerations that need to be addressed during HLD/LLD or future planning sessions.

---

### 🔌 Integrations with External Services

- What level of integration do we want with:
  - **Hotel booking providers**: iframe/embed vs full API?
  - **Insurance providers**: redirect flow vs embedded widget vs direct API call with PDF generation?
  - **Tour aggregators**: affiliate links only or live API feeds?
- Do we plan to support **multiple providers per category**, or just one trusted partner at launch?
- Will we offer **fallback experiences** if partner APIs are temporarily unavailable?

---

### 👤 User Accounts & Authentication

- When will user accounts be introduced: P0, P1, or later?
- What features will require authentication (e.g. bookings, saving preferences, access to documents)?
- What data should be stored in the user profile (e.g. nationality, past trips, personal info)?
- Do we need social login (Google, Apple) or just email/password?

---

### 🗃 Data Storage vs Proxying

| Data Type                       | Store in Our DB? | Pass to External API? | Notes                                   |
|--------------------------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| User personal data (email, name, passport) | ❓               | ✅                     | Required for insurance; may need partial storage |
| Booking metadata (date, city, hotel/tour)   | ❓               | ✅                     | Could store locally for analytics       |
| Payment records (status, amount)           | ❓               | ✅                     | Store only reference, actual via Stripe/Fondy |
| Tour listings (curated)                   | ✅               | ❓                     | Mixed model: ours + partners            |
| Hotel data                                 | ❓               | ✅                     | Primarily from partner feed             |

Questions:
- Which data do we store persistently vs treat as ephemeral/session-based?
- Do we require GDPR-style data deletion and user access/export functionality?

---

### 🛠 Admin Panel & Content Ownership

- When will the admin UI be built: at launch or as a post-MVP tool?
- Will dynamic content (e.g. tours) be edited through admin UI or static file pull requests in early phases?

---

### 📄 Booking Ownership

- If a booking is made through the portal, but processed externally:
  - Can we still track it for analytics or support purposes?
  - Do we generate our own confirmation reference number or reuse the external one?
  - Will users be able to access their documents again via our portal?

---

### 🔐 Security & Legal

- What legal disclaimers or T&Cs do we need to include around:
  - Third-party responsibility (insurance, hotels, tours)?
  - Data usage and user consent?
- Do we need an internal audit log for content edits or booking activity?

---

### 🧭 Future Considerations

- Will we evolve toward a fully self-hosted CRS for hotels and tours?
- How will versioning of guidance content be handled when laws change?
- Will we support Ukrainian domestic travelers or just foreign visitors?
